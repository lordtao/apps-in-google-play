## **Silent Channel**
**A truly serverless, peer-to-peer (P2P) communication tool built with WebRTC and Kotlin Multiplatform.**

Silent Channel is a technical experiment designed to eliminate the "third party" from digital conversations. Unlike traditional messengers, it operates without any central signaling servers, cloud services, or metadata logging.
### **Key Features:**
- **Pure P2P:** Direct device-to-device connection.
- **Zero Infrastructure:** No accounts, no phone numbers, and no servers—even for handshakes.
- **Privacy by Architecture:** Exchange connections via manual Offer/Answer files (SDP) through any channel you trust.
- **Ephemeral:** No message history is stored on the device or any server.
- **De-Googled:** Completely free from Firebase, Google Play Services, and analytics.

## **Weather and Wardrobe Assistant**
### **Choose clothes for the weather — Scientifically and Effortlessly.**
**Weather and Wardrobe Assistant** is an intelligent application designed to ensure maximum comfort by recommending outfits based on precise weather conditions, your activity level, and personal preferences.

Unlike traditional weather apps or basic virtual closets, our assistant utilizes complex scientific methods to calculate clothing heat transfer (thermal insulation), factoring in your body type and physical exertion.
### **Key Features**
- **Scientific Approach:** Precise calculation of thermal insulation (Clo) based on experimental physical data of fabrics.
- **Activity-Based Selection:** Tailored outfit recommendations for different states: sitting, walking, running, or working.
- **Ready-to-Use Templates:** A comprehensive library of templates for clothes, shoes, and headwear with pre-defined physical characteristics—ready to use instantly.
- **AI Wardrobe Editor:** Easily add items, remove backgrounds using the latest AI, and customize colors to match your real-life wardrobe.
- **Smart Planning:** Automated notifications with outfit suggestions for today and tomorrow, plus travel planning for any location worldwide.
- **Deep Personalization:** Adjust your profile to match your individual sensitivity to heat and cold.
### **How It Works**
1. **Your Wardrobe:** Build your digital closet using verified templates or your own photos.
1. **Your Activity:** Tell the app what you'll be doing (heading to the office, exercising, or relaxing).
1. **Calculation:** The algorithm matches the weather in any location with your specific wardrobe to find the most comfortable combinations.
1. **Result:** No more guessing—stay comfortable regardless of whether the thermometer seems misleading.
